## motivation
The documentation is build up in the following parts: first, there is the quickstart tutorial which aims at getting you started with PyBrain as quickly as possible. This is the right place for you if you just want get a feel for the library or if you never used PyBrain before.
Although the quickstart uses supervised learning with neural networks as an example, this does not mean that thatâ€™s it. PyBrain is not only about supervised learning and neural networks.
While the quickstart should be read sequentially, the tutorial chapters can mostly be read independently of each other.
In case this does not suffice, we also have an API reference, the Module Index. Most of the packages and modules of PyBrain are auto-documented there.
If you want to develop for PyBrain and contribute, check out our guidelines in our wiki: http://wiki.github.com/pybrain/pybrain/guidelines.
If at any point the documentation does not suffice, you can always get help at the pybrain Google Group at http://groups.google.com/group/pybrain.
